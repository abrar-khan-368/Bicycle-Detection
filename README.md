# Bicycle Detection Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to perform object detection with a focus on bicycles using OpenCV and a deep learning model. The notebook walks through the following steps:

## Steps Included

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Import necessary libraries including OpenCV and NumPy.
   - Verify the installed version of OpenCV.

2. **Loading and Displaying Images**:
   - Load an image containing bicycles using OpenCV.
   - Display the image to visualize the input data.

3. **Preprocessing for Object Detection**:
   - Convert the input image into a blob for input to the neural network.
   - Resize the image and normalize pixel values.

4. **Loading Model and Class Labels**:
   - Load the class labels for the objects the model can detect.
   - Load a pre-trained deep learning model for object detection (likely YOLO or a similar architecture).

5. **Performing Object Detection**:
   - Run the model on the input image to detect objects.
   - Filter out predictions with low confidence scores.
   - Draw bounding boxes around detected bicycles (and other objects) and label them.

6. **Displaying Results**:
   - Display the image with bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.
